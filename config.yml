              My name is Bianca and I'm a software engineer from Philadelphia. Most recently, I was a software engineer at QVC and built applications within the supply chain domain.
              I graduated from Temple University with a Bachelor of Science in [Information Science and Technology](https://www.temple.edu/academics/degree-programs/information-science-and-technology-major-st-ist-bs).
             <br /> <br />I grew up in the 'burbs of Chicago and am a big fan of Lou Malnati's for deep dish pizza. I enjoy watching Esports and solving puzzles from [Puzzled Pint](http://puzzledpint.com/). When I'm not at my computer I'm most likely making coffee,
             reading, or crocheting.

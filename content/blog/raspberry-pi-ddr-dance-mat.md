<p> Before I started playing rhythm games like sound voltex and osu, I was a fan of dance dance revolution. All my Wii console gamers can attest to how much of a blast DDR Hottest Party was.
So when I saw this <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/build-arcade-dance-game/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to create your own DDR game using a Raspberry Pi I knew I had to build it.

This was a fun project for me to combine the things I enjoy: crochet and technology. I used the circuit playground express instead of the classic listed in the tutorial, crocheted the dance mat (outlined the layout using StichFiddle), and had to troubleshoot the code in the dance controller software since the capacitive touch wasnâ€™t responsive initially. 
Looking back, I should have considered the placement of the conductive thread stitches because the up and down arrows were interfering with each other at first. And I would have followed a more elegant stitch pattern. This time, I wanted to get that MVP going.

Before I started playing rhythm games like Sound Voltex and osu!, I played Dance Dance Revolution for the Wii. 
So when I saw this <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/build-arcade-dance-game/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to create your own DDR game using a Raspberry Pi I knew I had to build it. 
</p>
<p>
This was a fun project for me to combine the things I enjoy: crochet and technology. I used the Circuit Playground Express instead of the classic listed in the tutorial, crocheted the dance mat, and had to troubleshoot the code in the dance controller software since the capacitive touch wasnâ€™t responsive initially. 
Looking back, I should have considered the placement of the conductive thread from the dance mat to the terminal block more thoroughly because the up and down arrows were interfering with each other (taped the excess threads away from each other which worked but not the most elegant solution lol). This time, I wanted to get that MVP going and I was excited to start gaming with it.

<p>I used Premier's Anti-Pilling Everyday Worsted yarn for this project! I made the pattern using <a href="https://www.stitchfiddle.com/en" target="_blank">Stitch Fiddle</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a quick demo! Maybe I'll crochet a controller for the rhythm game Taiko no Tatsujin next...</p>

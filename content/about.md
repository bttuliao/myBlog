<h3>What do you like to do?</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>I like to crochet, make coffee with way too much sugar, and watch esports. Trying things out and getting outside of my comfort zone is also important to me. I grew up in the â€˜burbs of Chicago and moved to Philadelphia for college. My desire to learn goes beyond computers and I like learning about new places, cultures, and cuisines.</p>
